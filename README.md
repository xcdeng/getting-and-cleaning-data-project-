About R scripts
-------------------------------------
I created a script called R_project.R which:

 1. set the default directory to the directory with the data
 2. identify columns with mean and std only
 3. use descriptive activity names to name the activities

 5. add in activity labels and features 
 6. combine data
 7. aggregation (mean) based on subject and activity
